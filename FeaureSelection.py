#Feature selection method
#1. Filter method
    #Variance
    #Correlation
    #Univariate selection
    
  #Filter methods has two step procedure:
    #rank features according to a certain criteria
    #select the highest ranking features
   
  #Feature scores on various statistical tests:
      #Chi square/ Fisher score
      #Univariate parametric tests (anova)
      #Mutual information
      #Variance
        #constant features
        #Quasi-constant features
        
#2. Wrapper methods
    #Forward selection: add 1 feature at a time
    #Backward selection: removes 1 feature at a time
    #Exhaustive selection: searches acorss all possible feature combinations
  #use predictive machine learning models to score the feature subset
#3. Embedded methods
   #LASSO
   #Tree importance
